      <p>
        The Undergraduate Research Association shines a spotlight on the work of undergraduate 
        students working in interdisciplinary research. We recognize both the diverse interests 
        of students at UCLA and the increased need for nuanced approaches to solving our society's 
        most pressing issues. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By hosting monthly seminars, providing peer mentorship, and running 
        an annual poster research symposium, the Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Association 
        provides the space for UCLA's undergraduate researchers from across disciplines to build 
        community in research.

      <h2>Apply for Poster Day</h2>
      <p>
        Poster Day 2024 hosted by the Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Association is a UCLA-wide opportunity for 
        undergraduate researchers to present their interdisciplinary research through poster presentations 
        in a public forum. Creating such a space allows undergraduate students to cultivate skills necessary 
        for a future career in research, including effective public speaking, scientific communication and 
        productive cross-disciplinary discourse. Additionally, the event opens opportunities for interdisciplinary 
        researchers to connect and build a community.
