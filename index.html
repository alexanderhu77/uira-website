          <p>
            The Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Association shines a spotlight on the work of undergraduate 
            students working in interdisciplinary research. We recognize both the diverse interests 
            of students at UCLA and the increased need for nuanced approaches to solving our society's 
            most pressing issues. 
          </p>
          <p>
            By hosting monthly seminars, providing peer mentorship, and running 
            an annual poster research symposium, the Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Association 
            provides the space for UCLA's undergraduate researchers from across disciplines to build 
            community in research.

        <h2>Apply for Poster Day</h2>
        <p>
          Poster Day 2024 hosted by the Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Association is a UCLA-wide opportunity for 
          undergraduate researchers to present their interdisciplinary research through poster presentations 
          in a public forum. Creating such a space allows undergraduate students to cultivate skills necessary 
          for a future career in research, including effective public speaking, scientific communication and 
          productive cross-disciplinary discourse. Additionally, the event opens opportunities for interdisciplinary 
          researchers to connect and build a community.
