        <p>
          Poster Day 2024 hosted by the Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Association is a UCLA-wide opportunity for 
          undergraduate researchers to present their interdisciplinary research through poster presentations 
          in a public forum. Creating such a space allows undergraduate students to cultivate skills necessary 
          for a future career in research, including effective public speaking, scientific communication and 
          productive cross-disciplinary discourse. Additionally, the event opens opportunities for interdisciplinary 
          researchers to connect and build a community.
